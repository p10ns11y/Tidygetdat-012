# Course Project Getting and Cleaning Data


Running run_analysis.R :

* load run_analysis.R using source("run_analysis.R")
* tidy_acc_sensor_data.txt is the resultant tidy data

* Descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set:

        walking         - subject walking straight
        
        walkingupstairs - subject walking in the up stairs
        
        walkingdownstairs - subject walking the down stairs

        standing          -  subject is standing
        
        laying            - subject is laying

* The script also appropriately labels the data set with descriptive names: For example,
 

        tbodyacc-mean-x        - time domain body accelaration  signals in x axis       
        
        tgravityacc-mean-x  - time domain gravity accelaration  signals in x axis
        
        where in "tbodyacc-mean-x" t represents time, acc represnts accelaration , x represents x-axis
